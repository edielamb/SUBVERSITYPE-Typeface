SUBVERSITYPE

SUBVERSITYPE is designed for institutions that speak without caring to be understood. Although designed following a strict set of rules, consistency does not equal comprehension. Each glyph is built from an equal number of bars on a set grid, bar height varies to form the letter forms. This project is meant to undermine the inhuman, systematic methods of conveying information, reflecting how institutions “provide” information but do not prioritize comprehension.

**This font is still in very early stages of production. Not all glyphs on the keyboard have been designed yet, and some perimeters need to be improved upon.**
